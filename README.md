 - 👋 Hi, I’m @dominickyacono, a master's student at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy.
 -    I'm primarily interested in the use of statistical research and data science to study economic outcomes, market dynamics, and cutting-edge innovation.
 -    Welcome to my portfolio of side/personal projects:
     <br>
    - **[Is The SAT or ACT Better To Take For Long-term Success?](https://github.com/dominickyacono/SAT-vs-ACT-regression-analysis)**

    - **[Exploratory Data Analysis of Bicycle Business](https://github.com/dominickyacono/Exploratory-Analysis-of-Bicycle-Business)**
      This project uses SQL querying to extract data from a Bicycle shop database.
      I also use Python packages (pandas, matplotlib, scipy.stats) to graph, model, and uncover insights.
