ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dominickyacono, a data analytics and economics student studying at The Ohio State University.
Curious in the growing universe of big data, Iâ€™m currently learning a variety of skills both in and outside of school: 
 - SQL 
 - Python
 - R
 - Java
 - Tableau
My goal is to utilize my technical skills and work with others towards driving decision making for businesses!
Here on GitHub, check out my personal project analyzing a bicycle business database using SQL querying and Python data modeling!
Feel free to reach out at yacono.5@osu.edu!
