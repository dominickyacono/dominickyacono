 - 👋 Hi, I’m @dominickyacono, a data analytics and economics student studying at The Ohio State University.
 - 📊 I'm interested in the ways businesses can utilize data driven strategies towards reaching their goals! 
 - ❗️ I have begun developing personal projects to highlight key data analysis skills:
 - **Exploratory Data Analysis of Bicycle Business**
   - This project uses SQL querying to extract data from a Bicycle shop database.  
     I also use Python packages (pandas, matplotlib, scipy.stats) to graph, model, and uncover insights. 
     
- Technical skills I'm learning both in and outside of school: 
  - SQL 
  - Python
  - R
  - Java
  - Tableau
