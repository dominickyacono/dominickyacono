 - 👋 Hi, I’m @dominickyacono, a data analytics and economics student studying at The Ohio State University.
 - 📊 I'm interested in the ways businesses can utilize data driven strategies towards reaching their goals! 
 - ❗️ Welcome to my portfolio of side/personal projects:
    - **Is The SAT or ACT Better To Take For Long-term Success?**
      - This project utilizes Ordinary Least Squares, producing multiple predictive models to predict which high school standardized exam is more likely to deliver long-term success.
    - **Exploratory Data Analysis of Bicycle Business**
      - This project uses SQL querying to extract data from a Bicycle shop database.  
        I also use Python packages (pandas, matplotlib, scipy.stats) to graph, model, and uncover insights. 
    - **NYC Bike Sharing System Visualization**
      - This project uses Tableau's visualization abilities to graph and analyze trends within the Big Apple's massive bike sharing system.
     
- Technical skills I'm learning both in and outside of school: 
  - SQL 
  - Python
  - R
  - Java
  - Tableau
