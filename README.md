 - 👋 Hi, I’m @dominickyacono, a student double majoring in economics & data analytics at The Ohio State University.
 -    I'm primarily interested in the use of statistical research and data science to study economic outcomes, market dynamics, and cutting-edge innovation.
 -    Welcome to my portfolio of side/personal projects:
    - **[Is The SAT or ACT Better To Take For Long-term Success?](https://github.com/dominickyacono/SAT-vs-ACT-regression-analysis)**
      - This project produces multiple predictive models to predict which high school standardized exam is more likely to deliver long-term success.
    - **[What Are The Causal Influences Behind Sleep Time In Mammals?](https://github.com/dominickyacono/sleeptime-analysis)**
      - This project uses R to create OLS regression and ridge regression models to find the causal factors of sleep time in mammals.
    - **[Exploratory Data Analysis of Bicycle Business](https://github.com/dominickyacono/Exploratory-Analysis-of-Bicycle-Business)**
      - This project uses SQL querying to extract data from a Bicycle shop database.  
        I also use Python packages (pandas, matplotlib, scipy.stats) to graph, model, and uncover insights. 
    - **[NYC Bike Sharing System Visualization](https://github.com/dominickyacono/NYC-citibike-visualization)**
      - This project uses Tableau's visualization abilities to graph and analyze trends within New York City's massive bike sharing system.
     
- Technical skills: 
  - SQL 
  - Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, TensorFlow)
  - R
  - Java
  - Tableau
  - PowerBI
